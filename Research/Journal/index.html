        <h3>Reflection on Best practices for form design</h3>
        <time datetime="2025-01-19"> Jan 19, 2026</time>
        <p>According to the article "Best practices for form design", I have learned a lot of important practices to boost a form's usability. Few practices I found really important is minimizing the input fields, one column layout, explain any input or formatting requirements, label, placeholder text, form feedback, and accessibility. This practices were chosen from me because of specific reasons, minimizing the input fields was chosen because of its point of keeping the form short, and only asking questions that are actually needed. One columnb layout was chosen because it uses a one column layout so it is easier to scan and follow. For explain any input or formatting requirements, it gives guidance early, like formatting rules or examples, so users know what to do before submitting. Moving on, I bridged label and placeholder text together as one due to keeping labels visible and doesn't rely only on placeholder text because it disapperas when typing. Form feedback requires a specific message to show close to the field for an easy fix of error. Lastly, accessibility makes sure that it is readable and accessible such as good contrast, and clear text. The goal of this article is to teach how to make fewer mistakes and less frustration for the users.</p>

        <p>The canvas login is the online form I have been interacting a lot daily for past few years. I believe it has clear and simple labels, only asking for required informations, the page also has good accessibility with easy readability which makes it quick access to canvas.</p>
