        <h3>Reflection on my own image topic</h3>

        <p>
       My night desk setup image is interesting because the lighting changes the mood of the whole workspace. The glow from the monitors creates a strong contrast and makes the scene feel focused, even though it is a normal everyday setup. The most obvious element is the bright screens, but the part that matters most is what the setup represents. This image connects to my archive topic because it documents the tools and environment I rely on for design work and gaming. It also tells a story about me because it shows I care about customization, organization, and comfort, especially when working late. If I rephotograph this, I would choose a clearer focal point and clean up the frame edges so the composition feels more intentional.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on Karley Makar's image topic</h3>
        <time datetime="2026-02-11"> Feb 11, 2026</time>

        </figure>

        <p>
       When I first saw Karley’s photo, I guessed it was taken in a national park because of the rock formation and the trees. My first guess was Yosemite, but it was not. It was a camping area near Yosemite, which makes sense because the landscape feels similar. What grabbed my attention most was the small house or structure at the top of the rock. That detail makes the image more interesting by giving a sense of scale and raising questions about how someone got up there and what the structure is for. I suggested Karley zoom in or crop tighter on the house at the top so viewers feel more curious and try to guess the location and the story behind the scene.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h3>
        <time datetime="2026-02-09"> Feb 09, 2026</time>
        <p>This assignment made me realize that looking and observing are not the same. The New York Times article says reading images is like detective work, and the three questions made me slow down and think more carefully. When I asked myself, what do I see that makes me say that, I had to notice details instead of just reacting. It also made me see how easy it is to assume a story from a photo without enough evidence. For my example, I selected The Pudding because its use of scrolling and interactive elements directs the viewer's attention. I appreciate that this approach controls the pacing, allowing me to engage more deeply with the visuals and comprehend them incrementally. The site effectively guides users in interpreting information as they progress. However, when using a mobile device or scrolling too quickly, it is easy to overlook significant details, and at times, the interactive features can detract from the central message. Overall, this research reinforced the idea that effective visual thinking requires clarity and evidence, and that interactive design should facilitate rather than hinder this process.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</h3>
        <time datetime="2026-01-29"> Jan 29, 2026</time>
        <p>At first, overlays seem like an easy solution because they keep users on the same page. But after reading the Nielsen Norman Group article, I saw that this convenience can get annoying fast. An overlay is a small box that pops up over a page and dims the background. If it shows more than a quick message, it can cause issues. The “five Ws” checklist—who, what, when, where, and why—really stood out to me. It made me realize that overlays should have a clear purpose, not just be used out of habit. If users need to read a lot, scroll, bookmark, share, or use the Back button, a full page works better. The mobile examples showed this, since overlays can hide the close button or stop scrolling, which can trap users. After reading the article, I think overlays should only be used for urgent actions that the user starts, like confirming something hard to undo or collecting one key detail. For everything else, I would use in-page content so users can move around and stay in control.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on Best practices for form design</h3>
        <time datetime="2026-01-19"> Jan 19, 2026</time>
        <p>According to the article "Best practices for form design", I have learned a lot of important practices to boost a form's usability. Few practices I found really important is minimizing the input fields, one column layout, explain any input or formatting requirements, label, placeholder text, form feedback, and accessibility. This practices were chosen from me because of specific reasons, minimizing the input fields was chosen because of its point of keeping the form short, and only asking questions that are actually needed. One columnb layout was chosen because it uses a one column layout so it is easier to scan and follow. For explain any input or formatting requirements, it gives guidance early, like formatting rules or examples, so users know what to do before submitting. Moving on, I bridged label and placeholder text together as one due to keeping labels visible and doesn't rely only on placeholder text because it disapperas when typing. Form feedback requires a specific message to show close to the field for an easy fix of error. Lastly, accessibility makes sure that it is readable and accessible such as good contrast, and clear text. The goal of this article is to teach how to make fewer mistakes and less frustration for the users.</p>

        <p>The canvas login is the online form I have been interacting a lot daily for past few years. I believe it has clear and simple labels, only asking for required informations, the page also has good accessibility with easy readability which makes it quick access to canvas.</p>
